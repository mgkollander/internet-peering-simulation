IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not the author of this code. This code was written by Jedidiah Pollard.

The code emphasizes a simplified simulation of Internet peering relationships and routing updates between ISPs. The network topology is represented using a dictionary to keep track of link costs. The peering relationships and routing updates are randomly generated for demonstration purposes. The code provides insights into how ISPs peer with each other and how their routing tables evolve over time.
